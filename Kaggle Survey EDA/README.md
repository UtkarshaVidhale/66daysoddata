Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020/data">2020 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey</a>

### Data Preparation
Although the original dataset is in a well-formatted structure, I modified some part of it to draw some findings related to some questions as following points:
- The survey questions located at the top row --> need to be deleted
- The first column of the data frame(Survey Duration) is not relevant info --> need to be deleted
- Multiple choice responses are already distributed into each columns --> no need to process
- Note that all columns (survey questions) are categorical variables

#### Key Results:
 - Data science continues to have a heavy gender imbalance, with most identifying as male.
 - The vast majority of data scientists are under 35 years old.
 - Over half of data scientists have graduate degrees
 - Tableau and PowerBI are the most popular business intelligence tools
 - Data scientists tend to be in their late 20s or early 30s, with about 60% between 22 and 34.
 - Only one in five professional data scientists are 40 or older.
 - There are signs of the numbers skewing even younger, as generation Z gets more involved. Nearly 7% of data scientists are aged 18-21.
 - Fewer than 5% of data scientists have no degree beyond a high school diploma.
